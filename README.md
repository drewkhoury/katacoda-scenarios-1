# Contino learning on Katacoda 

This repo stores the code for the [Katacoda scenarios](https://katacoda.com/contino/) which we're currently using to run our Kubernetes training.

Each `.json` in the parent directory creates a course, which scenarios belong to.

## Contributions

First, you want to fork this repo and sign up at [Katacoda](https://katacoda.com/login) with your GitHub handle.

For each scenario, please do the following:

1. Create a card on the respective [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/7SvNAROB/kubernetes-training)
1. Work on the scenario, try it out in your own environment `https://www.katacoda.com/$GITHUBHANDLE`
1. When you're satisfied, send in a pull request.
1. Next, get two reviews/thumbs up from approvers
1. Once your scenario has been reviewed, we will merge it and it will appear on https://katacoda.com/contino

## Approvers

**How to approve / what to look for:**

Approvers should review the module as a second set of eyes to ensure it flows well (no issues when walking through the course).

Approvers should also check that content is approriate for Contino branding, given these are public.
